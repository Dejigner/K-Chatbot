Larger chunk sizes preserve more context but may reduce search precision, while smaller chunks provide more granular search results but may lose contextual information.

Adjust these parameters based on your document types and use cases. Technical documents with complex diagrams may benefit from larger chunks to preserve context, while reference materials might work better with smaller, more focused chunks. The overlap parameter ensures important information spanning chunk boundaries is not lost during processing.

**Vector Store Configuration:** The vector store component manages document embeddings and similarity search. The primary configuration choice is the embedding model, with options ranging from lightweight models like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (suitable for resource-constrained environments) to high-performance models like `hkunlp/instructor-xl` (recommended for optimal accuracy).

Consider your hardware limitations when selecting embedding models. Larger models provide better semantic understanding but require more memory and processing time. The system supports dynamic model loading, allowing you to experiment with different models without reconfiguring the entire system.

**Language Model Integration:** The LLM interface supports various local language models in GGUF format. Configuration options include context window size (default 4096 tokens), maximum response length (default 512 tokens), and sampling temperature (default 0.1 for factual responses). These parameters significantly impact response quality and system performance.

Lower temperature values produce more deterministic, factual responses suitable for educational content, while higher values generate more creative but potentially less accurate responses. The context window size determines how much source material can be included in each query, directly affecting the system's ability to provide comprehensive answers.

### Advanced Configuration Options

For users requiring specialized functionality or operating in unique environments, Klaro provides numerous advanced configuration options.

**Security Configuration:** The security module includes comprehensive options for input validation, rate limiting, and content filtering. Maximum query length can be adjusted based on your use cases, with longer limits allowing more complex questions but potentially increasing processing time and security risks.

Rate limiting parameters control how many requests individual users can make within specified time windows. Adjust these values based on your expected usage patterns and available system resources. Educational environments with many concurrent users may require more permissive limits, while single-user installations can use stricter controls.

Content filtering options help ensure appropriate educational use. The system includes basic inappropriate content detection, but you can customize filtering rules based on your specific requirements and educational standards.

**Performance Optimization:** Advanced users can fine-tune numerous performance parameters to optimize system behavior for their specific hardware and usage patterns. Memory management options control how aggressively the system caches frequently accessed data, trading memory usage for response speed.

Parallel processing settings determine how many CPU cores are utilized for various operations. Document processing, embedding generation, and vector search can all benefit from parallel execution, but excessive parallelization may overwhelm system resources and actually decrease performance.

## Model Setup

### Language Model Selection and Installation

Choosing and installing appropriate language models is crucial for optimal system performance and response quality.

**Model Selection Criteria:** The choice of language model significantly impacts both system performance and response quality. Consider several factors when selecting models: model size (affecting memory requirements and inference speed), training focus (general-purpose vs. instruction-tuned), and quantization level (affecting quality vs. performance trade-offs).

For educational applications, instruction-tuned models generally provide better results as they are specifically trained to follow directions and provide helpful responses. Models in the 7-billion parameter range offer an excellent balance of capability and resource requirements for most educational use cases.

**Recommended Models:** Several models have been extensively tested with Klaro and provide excellent educational performance. Mistral-7B-Instruct offers outstanding general knowledge and reasoning capabilities with moderate resource requirements. The model excels at providing clear, educational explanations and maintaining factual accuracy when working with source materials.

Phi-3-Mini provides impressive performance in a much smaller package, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments or when fast response times are prioritized over maximum accuracy. Despite its smaller size, Phi-3-Mini demonstrates strong reasoning capabilities and educational content generation.

OpenChat models are optimized for conversational interactions and provide natural, engaging responses that work well in educational chatbot applications. These models excel at maintaining context across multiple exchanges and providing responses that feel natural and educational.

**Model Download and Installation:** Language models in GGUF format can be downloaded from various sources, with Hugging Face being the most comprehensive and reliable repository. Navigate to the Hugging Face model repository and locate the specific model variant you wish to use.

GGUF models are available in various quantization levels, typically denoted by suffixes like Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, or Q8_0. Higher quantization levels (Q8_0) preserve more model quality but require more memory and storage space. Lower quantization levels (Q4_K_M) significantly reduce resource requirements while maintaining acceptable quality for most educational applications.

Download the selected model file to your `models` directory. These files are typically 3-7 GB in size, so ensure adequate storage space and a stable internet connection. Some models may be distributed across multiple files, requiring all parts to be downloaded and properly assembled.

**Model Validation and Testing:** After downloading, validate the model file integrity and test basic functionality. The system includes built-in model validation that checks file format and basic loading capabilities. Run a simple test query to ensure the model loads correctly and produces reasonable responses.

Consider testing multiple models with your specific document types and question patterns to identify the best fit for your use case. Different models may excel in different subject areas or response styles, and the optimal choice depends on your specific educational requirements.

### Embedding Model Configuration

Embedding models are responsible for converting text into numerical representations that enable semantic search and similarity matching.

**Embedding Model Selection:** The choice of embedding model significantly impacts search quality and system performance. Larger embedding models generally provide better semantic understanding and more accurate search results but require more computational resources and memory.

The default recommendation is `hkunlp/instructor-xl`, which provides excellent performance for educational content across diverse subject areas. This model has been specifically trained to understand instructional content and provides superior results when working with textbook materials and educational queries.

For resource-constrained environments, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` offers a good balance of performance and efficiency. While not as capable as larger models, it provides acceptable results for most educational applications while requiring significantly fewer system resources.

**Model Download and Caching:** Embedding models are automatically downloaded and cached when first used. The initial download may take several minutes depending on model size and internet connection speed. Subsequent uses load the cached model much more quickly.

Monitor disk space usage as embedding models and their associated cache files can consume several gigabytes of storage. The system automatically manages cache files, but manual cleanup may be necessary in storage-constrained environments.

**Performance Optimization:** Embedding generation can be optimized through various configuration options. Batch processing settings determine how many text chunks are processed simultaneously, affecting both speed and memory usage. Larger batch sizes generally improve throughput but require more memory.

GPU acceleration can dramatically improve embedding generation speed if compatible hardware is available. The system automatically detects and utilizes available GPU resources, but manual configuration may be necessary for optimal performance in some environments.

## Document Preparation

Proper document preparation is essential for optimal system performance and search accuracy.

**Document Format Requirements:** Klaro is specifically designed to work with PDF documents, which are the standard format for textbooks and educational materials. The system supports PDF versions 1.4 through 2.0, covering virtually all commonly encountered PDF files.

Text-based PDFs provide the best results, as the system can directly extract and process textual content. Scanned PDFs or image-based documents may require optical character recognition (OCR) preprocessing before use with Klaro. While the system includes basic OCR capabilities, dedicated OCR software often provides superior results for heavily image-based documents.

**Document Quality Assessment:** High-quality source documents are crucial for optimal system performance. Documents should have clear, readable text with consistent formatting. Avoid documents with excessive formatting complexity, embedded multimedia content, or non-standard fonts that may interfere with text extraction.

Evaluate document structure and organization. Well-structured documents with clear headings, sections, and logical organization provide better search results and more accurate citations. Documents with poor structure may still work but may produce less precise search results and citations.

**Document Size and Scope Considerations:** While Klaro can handle individual documents up to 500 pages, consider the practical implications of very large documents. Extremely large documents may require significant processing time and memory during initial loading and indexing.

The system is optimized for collections of 10-20 documents totaling several thousand pages. Larger collections are supported but may require additional system resources and longer processing times. Consider breaking very large documents into logical sections if processing performance becomes problematic.

**Metadata and Organization:** Proper document organization and metadata management improve system usability and search accuracy. Use descriptive filenames that clearly identify document content and subject matter. Avoid special characters, spaces, or non-ASCII characters in filenames to prevent potential processing issues.

Consider organizing documents into logical groups or subjects. While the system can handle mixed subject matter, organizing documents by topic or academic level can improve search relevance and make citation management more intuitive.

### Document Processing and Indexing

The document processing pipeline converts raw PDF content into searchable, semantically meaningful chunks that enable accurate retrieval and citation.

**Text Extraction Process:** The system uses PyMuPDF (fitz) for robust PDF text extraction that preserves document structure and formatting information. This process handles various PDF encoding schemes, font types, and layout complexities commonly found in educational materials.

During extraction, the system identifies and preserves important structural elements such as headings, sections, and page boundaries. This information is crucial for generating accurate citations and maintaining document context in search results.

**Content Chunking Strategy:** Extracted text is divided into manageable chunks that balance context preservation with search granularity. The default chunk size of 500 characters with 50-character overlap provides good results for most educational content, but these parameters can be adjusted based on document characteristics and use requirements.

The chunking process attempts to respect natural text boundaries such as sentence endings and paragraph breaks. This approach helps maintain semantic coherence within chunks and improves the quality of search results and generated responses.

**Embedding Generation:** Each text chunk is converted into a high-dimensional vector representation using the selected embedding model. These embeddings capture semantic meaning and enable similarity-based search across the document collection.

The embedding generation process is computationally intensive and may take considerable time for large document collections. Progress is tracked and displayed during processing, and the system supports resuming interrupted processing sessions.

**Index Construction and Optimization:** Generated embeddings are organized into a FAISS index that enables fast similarity search across the entire document collection. The index construction process optimizes data structures for query performance while maintaining reasonable memory usage.

Index files are automatically saved and can be reloaded quickly in subsequent sessions. This caching mechanism eliminates the need to regenerate embeddings unless documents are added or modified.
